#|  This is called `external` due to historical reasons. This has evolved into 2 kinds of Leaf parts: AOT and JIT (statically generated before runtime, vs. dynamically generated at runtime). If a part name begins with ;:', it is treated specially as a JIT part, else the part is assumed to have been pre-loaded into the register in the regular way.  |# #|line 1|# #|line 2|#
