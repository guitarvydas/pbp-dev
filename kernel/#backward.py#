Program to read kernel.drawio.json and replace ":DONE" with "'DONE" and ":$" with "$"

HOW TO USE:
1. Save this script as "modify_drawio.py"
2. Place your kernel.drawio.json file in the same directory
3. Run the script: python modify_drawio.py
4. A new file "modified-kernel.drawio.json" will be created with the replacements
